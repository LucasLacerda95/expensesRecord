During this project, concepts of interaction with arrays, objects, functions and other language tools were used. To store the entries
I used the browser's own storage.

concepts practiced:

*Css - Grid, FlexBox, syntax and responsiveness

*Html - HTML structure, semantic tags, file references and input validation.

*JS - Arrays, Objects, Functions, Scope, Return Types, Browser Storage.
